   * - Key Componenet
     - Description
   * - ESP32-DU1906
     - This is a powerful, general-purpose, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth audio communication module, targeting a wide variety of applications ranging from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks, such as voice encoding/decoding, music streaming and running voice assistant client SDK.
   * - DIP Connector for SPI LCD
     - ESP32-Korvo-DU1906 has a 2.54 mm pitch connector to connect SPI LCD.
   * - Audio ADC (Audio Analog-to-Digital Converter)
     - ESP32-Korvo-DU1906 includes two ES7243 high-efficiency ADCs, with one for the collection of Audio PA outputs, and another for the collection of Line-in outputs. Both ADCs can be used for AEC.
   * - Line-in/out Connector (Earphone Jacks)
     - The two earphone jacks are used to connect to Line-out outputs of Audio DAC and Line-in inputs of Audio ADC respectively. When a device is plugged in the Line-out earphone jack of Audio DAC, the Audio PA on the ESP32-Korvo-DU1906 will be turned off.
   * - Speaker Connector
     - Output sockets to connect two 4-ohm speakers to provide stereo sound via digital Audio PA.
   * - Audio DAC (Audio Digital-to-Analog Converter)
     - ES7148 Stereo DAC is able to convert digital signals into analog audio outputs.
   * - Audio PA (Digital Audio Power Amplifier)
     - TAS5805M is a high-efficiency stereo closed-loop D-type amplifier with low power dissipation and rich sound. It can convert audio digital signals into high-power analog audio outputs and transmit them to external speakers for playback. When the Line-out earphone jack of the audio DAC plugged into the device, the Digital Audio PA on the ESP32-Korvo-DU1906 will be turned off. 
   * - Battery Connector
     - Connect a battery.
   * - Battery Charger
     - AP5056, a constant-current/constant-voltage linear power management chip, can be used for charging management to a single lithium-ion battery.
   * - PWR Slide Switch
     - Power switch for the board, turn on/off the power supply.

Start Application Development
-----------------------------

Before powering up the ESP32-Korvo-DU1906, please make sure that the board has been received in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.

Initial Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare the board for loading of the first sample application:

1. Connect 4-ohm speakers to the two **Speaker Connectors**. Connecting earphones to the **Line-out Connector** is an option.
2. Plug in the Micro-USB cables to the PC and to both **USB connectors** of the ESP32-Korvo-DU1906.
3. Assuming that a battery is connected, the **Charging LED** (red) will keep the lights on.
4. Toggle left the **PWR Slide Switch**.
5. The red **Power On LED** should turn on.

If this is what you see on the LEDs, the board should be ready for application upload. Now prepare the PC by loading and configuring development tools what is discussed in the next section.

Develop Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the board is initially set up and checked, you can start preparing the development tools. The Section :doc:`index` will walk you through the following steps:

* **Set up ESP-IDF** to get a common development framework for the ESP32 (and ESP32-S2) chips in C language;
* **Get ESP-ADF** to install the API specific to audio applications;
* **Setup Path to ESP-ADF** to make the framework aware of the audio specific API;
* **Start a Project** that will provide a sample audio application for the board;
* **Connect Your Device** to prepare the application for loading;
* **Build the Project** to finally run the application and play some music.
